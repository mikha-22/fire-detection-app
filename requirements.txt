# Note:
# - This file combines dependencies from src/cloud_functions/*/requirements.txt and src/ml_model/requirements.txt.
# - Explicit versions for torch, torchvision, torchserve, and torch-model-archiver are included as they are
#   pinned in the Dockerfile and src/ml_model/requirements.txt for compatibility.
# - Other packages are listed without specific versions to allow for flexible updates,
#   but consider pinning them if strict dependency management is required.
# - For local development, ensure these are installed in your virtual environment.
# - For Cloud Functions and Vertex AI, these are automatically picked up by their respective build processes.
